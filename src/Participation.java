/*
This class will be extended in the ad-hoc-assignment, and will be used
in future assignments, so it is highly recommended to solve this
assignment.

This class is part of software for ski racing administration.  The
class should contain object variables race, racer and bibnumber
(Startnummer).  Write a constructor for this class that is called
with, e.g.,

new Participation("Lienz 2011 Ladies' Slalom", "Mikaela Shiffrin", 40)

Add the following non-static methods to this class:

String getRace()
String getRacer()
int getBibnumber()
void print()

print() should output the following (without newline at the start or
end) for the Participation created by the constructor call above:

40 Mikaela Shiffrin (Lienz 2011 Ladies' Slalom)

Questions:

Should there also be setter methods for the object variables?  Why or
why not?
